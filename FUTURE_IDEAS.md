# Future ideas

These are design notes, not implemented behavior or requirements for the current
prototype.

## Multiple evaluation branches

Allow one task to contain multiple evaluation branches. Each branch owns one locked
X/y construction, CV setup and scoring contract, together with its own candidate
search graph. These evaluation branches are distinct from the pipeline lineage
branches inside an individual search graph.

The motivation is validation quality: a search policy can optimize its internal CV
score successfully while selecting pipelines that perform poorly on the prediction
population. Exploration may reveal that another population definition or CV setup
better represents the actual task.

MLE-claude demonstrated a useful behavior here: the model could reason about a
different evaluation setup using evidence from additional data exploration. Preserve
that ability without silently changing the contract of existing scored candidates.

A second motivation is feasibility. A setup can be representative and still limit
the search, because the population and row design fix which models and how many
experiments fit in the budget. On TrackTheTrackers (run sol-trackers-v3), the agent
locked a carefully target-matched, weighted validation. It modelled all 18.7M
domains, one row per domain with the tracker set as label. Every attempt then
spent most of its time rebuilding the population. A row of
labels per domain also ruled out standard learners, so the run plateaued with
count-based rankers (Recall@10 0.811). MLE-claude modelled (domain, tracker) pairs on
a 14k-domain sample. Standard learners fitted directly and it reached 0.881. Its own
learning curve later showed that a larger population would help, which it could only
act on in a new workspace. Evidence of this kind (learning curves, runtime per
attempt, model families the row design excludes) is a reason to open a branch, in
addition to evidence about representativeness.

### Proposing a branch

The controller or planner can propose another X/y/CV setup and explain why it should
better represent the prediction setting. Further exploration can support or challenge
the proposal with statistical evidence: population and coverage differences,
temporal drift, repeated entities, or differences between validation and prediction
conditions. Such evidence supports a hypothesis; it does not prove future performance.

Audit and lock the proposed setup independently. Preserve existing branches and
their results. Candidate code and relevant findings can inform the new branch, but
transferred candidates must be evaluated under its contract.

### Search policy

Selection becomes two decisions:

1. Which evaluation branch should receive the next allocation of work?
2. Which candidate inside that branch should be expanded?

Each branch can retain a greedy, MCTS or MCGS candidate policy. A separate allocation
policy must balance investigating evaluation quality with improving pipelines under
an established setup. A natural split mirrors today's roles: the LLM controller,
which already chooses actions the way MLE-claude's agent does, decides which branch
to open or work on from evidence. Inside a branch, the tree-search policy keeps
choosing which candidate to expand. Keep the first implementation sequential; multiple branches
do not require concurrent execution.

Scores, candidate rankings and reward backpropagation remain local to each contract.
Raw CV scores from different setups must not form a shared leaderboard: an easier
split can produce a larger score without producing a better model. Choosing between
branches needs evidence about evaluation representativeness as well as progress and
cost within each branch. Exploration findings can be shared with their scope and
provenance preserved.

### Open questions

- What evidence warrants opening another evaluation branch? Candidates are
  representativeness evidence and feasibility evidence (see above).
- How should the outer policy allocate budget without favoring optimistic CV setups?
- How should the final pipeline be selected when branch scores are incomparable?
- What context and candidate references should transfer between branches?

Multiple evaluation branches and their allocation policy are deferred. The current
nano-mle design should first support one agent-authored, locked evaluation setup.

## Retrieval memory

A third memory beside `window` and `full` (see the README's Memory section), modelled
on MLEvolve's retrospective memory ([MLEvolve](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.06473v1)).
MLEvolve keeps a static knowledge base of models per task type, used when drafting
the first solution. It also keeps a global memory: after every valid node it stores
the plan, outcome, analysis, logs, errors and metrics. Retrieval fuses lexical and
embedding (FAISS) rankings by reciprocal rank and depends on the stage: planning
queries with the plan text, debugging with the error message. Different agents read
different scopes (their own branch, successful trajectories of other branches).
Removing the memory dropped their lite-benchmark medal rate from 82% to 68%.

In nano-mle the memory API already carries what this needs. Each role passes a query:
the planner the controller's direction, the repairer the error, the writer its
intent. `observe` can maintain the index after each record write. The index must be
rebuildable from the journal so resume keeps working.

Open questions:

- What is indexed: whole records, or one entry per attempt (plan, outcome, error)?
- Embeddings add a dependency and possibly an API; keep them an optional extra.
- How large is the gain over `window` here? Measure it with the context-size chart
  and scores on the same tasks, as for search policies.
- With evaluation branches, retrieval needs scopes: within a branch and across
  branches, with provenance kept.
